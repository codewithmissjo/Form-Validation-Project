1. Create a new flask project

2. Create variables to store usernames and a password:
    usernames = ["missjo", "rohan", "jasraj", "andrew", "rahul", "yutika"]
    password = "password"

3. Build a form with 3 form fields:
    a. username
    b. password
    c. confirm password

4. Write a route/function to process the form using the following logic:
    a. If the username is already taken:
        return an error.
    b. else the username is available:
        proceed with the next validation check.
    c. check that the two password fields match.
    d. if they don't, return an error.
    e. if they do match, add the username to the database, and return success.

Helpful error messages.
5. Add code to your error.html and your app.py so that helpful error messages are provided when an error is given.

Sign in page.
6. In normal, conversational language, write out the logic for a sign-in form. To get you started: a) If the username is in the list of saved usernames, proceed with the next form validation check (password).
    a) if the username is in the list of saved usernames, continue.
        1) if the password the user typed in is the correct password, log them in.
        2) if not, error.
    b) if the username is NOT in the list of saved usernames, error.
